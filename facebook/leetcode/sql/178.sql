"""178. Rank Scores
https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores

Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. 
Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. 
In other words, there should be no 'holes' between ranks.
